# Voodoonauts Writing Fellowship
Voodoonauts is a fellowship for Black Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers that I am proud to be an alumna of. For their 3rd anniversary, I redesigned their website using React.

## How It's Made & Lessons Learned:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node


This site was created using React, styled components, React Scroll and React Router - aspects of using frameworks that I am more familiar with due to working on this project.

## Optimizations

Currently, the site is a single landing page, but given more time I would make the following optimizations:
- A "Bookshelf" full of all of the work put out by the fellowship itself and alumni, with a shoping experience
- A newsfeed page of tweets by the fellowship and its founders

## Examples:
Take a look at these other examples that I have in my portfolio:
